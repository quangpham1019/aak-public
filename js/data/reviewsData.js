After getting what felt like a child‚Äôs meal for dinner at a restaurant in Irvine and then trying to go to a couple other places on the way home for a snack only to discover they had closed early, my partner luckily remembered this place and suggested checking if it were open. Fortunately, it was, and although I ordered in person, the food was ready for takeout within a few minutes. I got the grilled tofu and rice combo, and it was great. Nothing fancy, but it  was well-seasoned and tasted like a home-cooked meal, which is exactly what I wanted.",
